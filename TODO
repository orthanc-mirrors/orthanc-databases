== Orthanc database plugins ==
==============================

-----------------------
Common - Database index
-----------------------

* Performance of joins in LookupResources: Create cached statement for
  LookupResources, that are grouped to search up to, say, 10 tags,
  instead of recompiling for each request
* Do not log "DatabaseCannotSerialize" errors in the plugin but only
  in Orthanc after all retries have been made.
* Try to avoid the use of temporary tables:
  https://discourse.orthanc-server.org/t/image-insert-are-too-slow-databse-performance-too-poor/3820


* Implement "large queries" for:
  - updating all metadata of a resource at once
  - update all maindicomtags of 4 resource levels at once


---------------------
Common - Storage area
---------------------

* Implement the "StoreDicom" option from the default filesystem
  storage area to run MySQL/PostgreSQL storage in index-only mode:
  https://orthanc.uclouvain.be/book/contributing.html

* Performance: Add a pool of connections to PostgreSQL/MySQL, as
  already done in the database index plugins

----------
PostgreSQL
----------

* Check if we can force the schema that is used.  By default, Orthanc
  is using the 'public' schema but, after a wrong command, we have seen
  a DB where there was a 'AttachedFiles' table in the public schema and another one in a
  'MyPacs' schema and Orthanc was actually using the 'MyPacs.AttachedFiles' table !!!
  Orthanc was then seeing only the most recent attached files !!!

* Have a separate "thread" to UpdateStatistics to avoid large computations ?


* Seems Orthanc might deadlock when there are plenty of conflicting transactions:

  https://groups.google.com/g/orthanc-users/c/1bkClfZ0KBA/m/s4AlwVh3CQAJ 

* use ReadCommited mode by default
* use 40 index connection count by default (not 50 because, by default, PG has 100 connections and we want at least
  a few connections to remain available for sys admins if e.g, 2 Orthanc instances are running on the same server)

-----
MySQL
-----

* Store revisions for metadata and attachments in MySQL (this is
  already implemented in PostgreSQL)

* MySQL performance => implement GlobalProperty_GetTotalSizeIsFast:

  https://discourse.orthanc-server.org/t/when-running-housekeeping-mysqld-exe-searching-and-dicom-transfer-is-slow/4921/9

* Add index to speed up wildcard search, as already done in PostgreSQL:

  - https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/fulltext-search.html +
    ALTER TABLE table ADD FULLTEXT index_name(column1);

  - https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/index-btree-hash.html

ODBC

* Implement labels
