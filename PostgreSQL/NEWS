* WARNING: An Index is being replaced to improve performance.  The creation
  of the new index can take some time (we have observed 3 minutes on a
  DB with 70M instances).  Orthanc will not be available during the
  creation of this index.  If needed, you can create it manually before installing
  the new plugin by executing this SQL command (extracted from
  https://orthanc.uclouvain.be/hg/orthanc-databases/file/default/PostgreSQL/Plugins/SQL/Upgrades/Rev2ToRev3.sql):

    CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS ChildrenIndex2 ON Resources USING btree (parentId ASC NULLS LAST) INCLUDE (publicId, internalId)

* WARNING: A new column has been added in the resources table when upgrading to this version.  A new thread
  is populating this new table and might consume DB bandwitdh and CPU until it has populated the column.  
  The creation of the new column might also take a few minutes the first time you launch this version.

* WARNING: when upgrading very large databases, make sur to read this section of the Orthanc book:
  https://orthanc.uclouvain.be/book/plugins/postgresql.html#note-for-large-databases-and-multiple-orthanc-instances

* Added support for ExtendedChanges introduced in Orthanc 1.12.5
  enabling new get arguments (type & to) in the /changes API route.
* Added support for ExtendedFind introduced in Orthanc 1.12.5
  enabling new filtering and ordering options in /tools/find API route.
* Performance optimizations:
  - reduced the number of round-trips between Orthanc and the PostgreSQL server:
    - replaced numerous small queries by a single large query in /tools/find.
    - reduced the number of queries when ingesting new instances.
  - using more prepared SQL statements

* Fixed a memory leak when executing non cached SQL statements (rarely used)
* New default values for configurations:
  - "IndexConnectionsCount": 50
  - "TransactionMode": "ReadCommitted"
* Introduced a new thread to perform DB Housekeeping at regular interval.  
  E.g: This avoids very long update times in case you don't call /statistics 
  for a long period.  The execution interval of this thread can be configured 
  through "HousekeepingInterval" (default: 1s).
* Fix updates from plugin version 3.3 to latest version
* Fix a bug introduced in 6.0 in the PatientRecyclingOrder when using patient protection.


Release 6.2 (2024-03-25)
========================

DB schema revision: 2
Minimum plugin SDK (for build): 1.12.3
Minimum Orthanc runtime: 1.12.3

* Fix check of Orthanc runtime version


Release 6.1 (2024-02-14)
========================

DB schema revision: 2

* Fix handling of MaximumStorageSize & MaximumPatientCount.


Release 6.0 (2024-02-08)
========================

DB schema revision: 2

* The DB schema has been updated to Revision 2.  If you need to reinstall the previous
  version of the plugin, you should run this script:
  https://orthanc.uclouvain.be/hg/orthanc-databases/file/tip/PostgreSQL/Plugins/SQL/Downgrades/Rev2ToRev1.sql
* Transaction Mode:
  Introduced a new configuration "TransactionMode" to select the transaction isolation level.
  Allowed values: "Serializable", "ReadCommitted".
  The "Serializable" mode was the only available value up to now.  It is still the default
  value now.
  The "ReadCommitted" is possible now due to rewrites of SQL queries and notably improves
  the Orthanc ability to ingest data from multiple sources in parallel.
* New "EnableVerboseLogs" configuration to show SQL statements being executed.


Release 5.1 (2023-06-27)
========================

Release 2.2 (2018-07-16)
========================

!! Important remark when upgrading from an older version of the plugin:

   The plugin will create a new index to improve search performance.
   This can take several minutes at the first Orthanc startup. Orthanc
   will not be available during this period. On a PostgreSQL database
   with 100,000 studies, we have observed that updating the index took
   around 10 minutes.

* Fix issue 41 (Additional range IdentifierConstraintType in Orthanc)
  !! This fix requires Orthanc version >= 1.4.0

  the connection to the server)
