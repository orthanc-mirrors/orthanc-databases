Release 2.2 (2018-07-16)
========================

!! Important remark when upgrading from an older version of the plugin:

   The plugin will create a new index to improve search performance.
   This can take several minutes at the first Orthanc startup. Orthanc
   will not be available during this period. On a PostgreSQL database
   with 100,000 studies, we have observed that updating the index took
   around 10 minutes.

* Migration into the "orthanc-databases" repository
* Full refactoring to share code with MySQL
* Fix issue 41 (Additional range IdentifierConstraintType in Orthanc)
  !! This fix requires Orthanc version >= 1.4.0
* Fix issue 47 (Index improvements for PG plugin)
* Fix issue 76 (PG connection shall reconnect/retry in case it loses
  the connection to the server)


Release 2.1 (2018-04-20)
========================

* Running transactions in "Serializable" isolation level to avoid 
  inconsistencies if multiple Orthanc are writing to the same DB
* Upgrade to PostgreSQL 9.6.1 client library for static builds
* Performance warning if runtime debug assertions are turned on
* Fix issue 62 (use correct type for lo_read() value)
* Fix issue 63 (allow to connect without specifing username and/or port)
* Fix issue 68 (PostgreSQL plugin needs extra flags to compile)
* Resort to Orthanc framework
* Support of Linux Standard Base, OpenBSD and FreeBSD
