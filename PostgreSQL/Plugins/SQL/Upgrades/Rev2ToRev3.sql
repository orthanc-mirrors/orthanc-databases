   -- do facilite an up-time upgrade
-- This file is executed only if the current schema is in revision 2 and it is executed 
-- before PrepareIndex.sql that is idempotent.


-- create a new ChildrenIndex2 that is replacing ChildrenIndex.
-- We create it in this partial update so it can be created while the system is up !
